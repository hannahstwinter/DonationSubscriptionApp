# DonationSubscriptionApp

The intent of this application is to provide an interface for a subscription service where users can donate to their favorite non-profits and/or charities.

The website will host both user profiles and company profiles. It will provide an interface for users to sort and filter through different companies by affiliated cause and other determining factors to help users decide which organization they wish to provide a financial donation to.

The user profiles will be configured with relevant user data in addition to payment data and frequency of donation (frequency of donation will be fluid and a user can update this whenever needed).

The company profiles will include relevant information surrounding the agency including hard data (address, contact info, etc.) and soft data (mission statement, images and success stories).
